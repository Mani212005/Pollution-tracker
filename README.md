🌬️ Air Pollution Forecasting & Alert System
A comprehensive Streamlit web application that provides real-time air quality forecasts, visualizations, and health alerts for major cities worldwide.

📜 About The Project
This project aims to provide an accessible and user-friendly platform for monitoring and forecasting air pollution. By leveraging real-time data and machine learning, the application predicts future PM2.5 levels, translates them into an understandable Air Quality Index (AQI), and offers crucial health advice.

It serves as a valuable tool for individuals, researchers, and public health officials to make informed decisions based on air quality conditions.

The backend is powered by ML models trained to forecast PM2.5 concentrations at 1, 3, 6, and 12-hour horizons, ensuring users receive timely and relevant information.

✨ Key Features
🔴 Real-time Data
Fetches live air quality and meteorological data from the WAQI (World Air Quality Index) platform.

🧠 Multi-Horizon Forecasting
Predicts PM2.5 levels for 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours into the future using pre-trained models.

📊 Dynamic AQI Calculation
Converts PM2.5 values into standard AQI categories: Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.

🩺 Health Alerts
Provides actionable health recommendations based on forecasted AQI levels.

🗺️ Interactive Visualizations

Live Map: Displays current AQI of the selected city.

Trend Analysis: Compares historical and predicted air quality over time.

Feature Importance: Shows key drivers like temperature and humidity.

Temporal Heatmap & Anomaly Detection: Detects recurring patterns and anomalies.

♻️ Carbon Footprint Calculator
Integrated tool to estimate personal environmental impact.

🧑‍💻 Robust & User-Friendly
Graceful fallback to dummy data ensures smooth experience even if live APIs fail.
